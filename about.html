        <h1>About Toolshed</h1>
        <p class="featured-text"><strong>Toolshed</strong> started with a simple question: Why should we all hold onto so many tools we barely ever use and barely maintain, just taking up space in our garages and sheds, waiting around for those stray moments when we need them? There had to be a better way.</p>

        <h2>Enter the Toolshed</h2>
        <p>We decided what the world needed was one big toolshed that we could all share together. Staffed by a team of experts why keep everything in tip-top shape, ready for you to use.

        <p>(Image of a tool collection - you choose one)</p>
            
        <p>That’s what we’ve built and we can’t wait to share it with you.</p>

        <h2>Our Founders</h2>

        <h3>Janine Appleton</h3>
        <p>Janine started out as a custom furniture manufacturer, but she quickly grew frustrated at having to spend a thousand dollars every time she needed a new specialty tool. That’s when the idea for Toolshed was born.</p>
